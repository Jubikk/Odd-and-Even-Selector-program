# Odd-and-Even-Selector-program

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

The Odd and Even Selector program is glad to have you. A file named numbers.txt will be read by this software. 
Integer numbers from 1 to 20 are contained in it. Following file reading, a few lines of the program will be executed, 
creating new text files with the numbers from the original file as their contents. The extracted folder will include 
even or odd integers from the original file and will be labeled "even.txt" and "odd.txt."

Thank you for using my program!!
